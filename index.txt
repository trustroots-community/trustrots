8:T1382,<h1>What You Need to Know about Trustroots But Haven't Been Told</h1>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Trustroots Foundation was <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09489825">dissolved on 24 May 2022</a>. Since July 2022, it has been operated by 3 private people, 2 of them former board members. Community members have been <a href="https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/commit/1a9185bc39e437290b0d4ccc07fb08be294844ef">intentionally kept</a> in <a href="https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues/2585">dark about this</a> by <a href="https://github.com/chmac">people</a> <a href="https://github.com/guaka">in</a> <a href="https://github.com/robokow">control</a>.</p>
<p>On 25 January 2024, volunteers were kicked out from Trustroots Github organization.</p>
<p>The people in control <a href="https://github.com/trustroots/nostroots">write about decentralization</a>, but perform censorship and centralization of control.</p>
<h2>What can I do?</h2>
<p>Please join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#volunteers:trustrooters.org">Trustroots Matrix channels</a>. Write message to the people in control via Trustroots. Open issues and comment on GitHub, if you don't mind getting banned. Subscribe for email updates (coming soon).</p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>On January 25, 2024, many volunteers were kicked out of <a href="https://github.com/Trustroots">Trustroots github organization</a>, some were completely banned. Also, <a href="https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+closed%3A2024-01-24..2024-01-27">hundreds of issues and pull requests were closed</a>, including extremely valuable ones like <a href="https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues/2654">accessibility feedback</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+closed%3A2024-01-24..2024-01-27+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug">bug reports</a>.</p>
