# What You Need to Know About Trustroots but Haven't Been Told

## TL;DR

Trustroots Foundation was [dissolved on 24 May 2022](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09489825). Since July 2022, Trustroots has been operated by 3 private people, 2 of them resigned board members. Community members have been [intentionally kept](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/commit/1a9185bc39e437290b0d4ccc07fb08be294844ef) in [dark about this](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues/2585) by [people](https://github.com/chmac) [in](https://github.com/guaka) [control](https://github.com/robokow).

On 25 January 2024, almost all [volunteers](https://www.trustroots.org/team) were kicked out from Trustroots Github organization.

The people in control [write about decentralization](https://github.com/trustroots/nostroots), but silence dissent, perform censorship and concentrate control in their own hands.

## Details

On January 25, 2024, many volunteers were kicked out of [Trustroots github organization](https://github.com/Trustroots), some were completely banned. Also, [hundreds of issues and pull requests were closed](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+closed%3A2024-01-24..2024-01-27). This was a culmination of 1.5 years of takeover by a small group of people.

## Timeline

- 25 - 27 January 2024 - Consolidation of control continues. Callum and Kasper [are changing information on Trustroots website](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/commits/master/?since=2024-01-20&until=2024-01-30), removing volunteering information, and promoting their new project. They also [revert recent code improvements](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/commit/902e0261718fcb6bff7b4c9ca2774d5f872e6187).
- 25 January 2024 - Without notice, almost all volunteers are removed from Github Trustroots organization.

- 2023-07 - Robino attempts to [update the information about Foundation](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/pull/2645). But bridging the gap between volunteers and ops seems impossible. The update is too vague, yet it can't get published.
