# What You Need to Know about Trustroots But Haven't Been Told

## TL;DR

Trustroots Foundation was [dissolved on 24 May 2022](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09489825). Since July 2022, it has been operated by 3 private people, 2 of them former board members. Community members have been [intentionally kept](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/commit/1a9185bc39e437290b0d4ccc07fb08be294844ef) in [dark about this](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues/2585) by [people](https://github.com/chmac) [in](https://github.com/guaka) [control](https://github.com/robokow). On 25 January 2024, volunteers were kicked out from Trustroots Github organization.

The 3 people in control [write about decentralization](https://github.com/trustroots/nostroots), but perform censorship and centralization of control.
