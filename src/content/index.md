# What You Need to Know About Trustroots but Haven't Been Told

## TL;DR

Trustroots Foundation was [dissolved on 24 May 2022](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09489825). Between July 2022 and March 2024, Trustroots was operated by 3 private people, 2 of them resigned board members. Community members have been [intentionally kept](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/commit/1a9185bc39e437290b0d4ccc07fb08be294844ef) in [dark about this](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues/2585) by [people](https://github.com/chmac) [in](https://github.com/guaka) [control](https://github.com/robokow).

On 25 January 2024, almost all [volunteers](https://www.trustroots.org/team) were kicked out from Trustroots Github organization.

One of the three people in control, who remained in contact with volunteers, was ["fired"](https://github.com/trustroots-community/trustrots/issues/2) by another one.

The remaining 2 people in control [write about decentralization](https://github.com/trustroots/nostroots), but silence dissent, perform censorship, and concentrate control in their own hands.

On 20 March 2024, [Foundation was restored](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09489825/filing-history), previous directors removed, and Callum and Kasper are the Board of Directors of Trustroots Foundation now.

As of 7 May 2024, the [website](https://www.trustroots.org/foundation) still needs to be updated with these changes.

## Details

On January 25, 2024, many volunteers were kicked out of [Trustroots github organization](https://github.com/Trustroots), some were completely banned. Also, [hundreds of issues and pull requests were closed](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+closed%3A2024-01-24..2024-01-27). This was a culmination of 1.5 years of takeover by a small group of people, after the [Trustroots Foundation had been dissolved](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09489825), and the main founder and developer had stopped being active.

## Timeline

- 20 March 2024 - Trustroots Foundation [is restored](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09489825/filing-history), the other directors are removed or resign, and Callum and Kasper become the Board of Directors.
- 3 - 4 February 2024 - [Callum publicly claims](https://github.com/trustroots-community/trustrots/issues/5) that Foundation [still exists](https://github.com/trustroots-community/trustrots/issues/5#issuecomment-1925224345) and that [he has full support of its directors](https://github.com/trustroots-community/trustrots/issues/5#issuecomment-1925839995), doesn't provide sufficient evidence.
- 31 January 2024 - [According to Callum, Robino has been fired](https://github.com/trustroots-community/trustrots/issues/2)
- 25 - 27 January 2024 - Consolidation of control continues. Callum and Kasper [are changing information on Trustroots website](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/commits/master/?since=2024-01-20&until=2024-01-30), removing volunteering information, and promoting their new project. They also [revert recent code improvements](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/commit/902e0261718fcb6bff7b4c9ca2774d5f872e6187).
- 25 January 2024 - Without notice, almost all volunteers are removed from Github Trustroots organization. [Hundreds of issues and pull requests are being closed without explanation](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues?q=closed%3A2024-01-24..2024-01-27+), including very valuable ones like [accessibility feedback](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues/2654) and [bug reports](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+closed%3A2024-01-24..2024-01-27+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug).

  When people express disagreement with this process, [their](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues/2661) [issues](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues/2662) [are](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues/2663) [deleted](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues/2664) [and](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues/2667) they are banned.

- 2023-09 - [100k members](https://grafana.trustroots.org/d/000000002/members?orgId=1&from=1693519200000&to=1696111200000)
- 2023-07 - Robino attempts to [update the information about Foundation](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/pull/2645). But bridging the gap between volunteers and ops seems impossible. The update is too vague, yet it can't get published.
- Some minor code improvements can be published thanks to Robino, who [occasionally merges them](https://github.com/trustrootsops/trustroots/commits/master/?author=robokow) to trustrootsops repository
- 2023-04 - After merging Trustroots code to trustrootsops repository, Ops [remove the information about Foundation dissolution](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/commit/1a9185bc39e437290b0d4ccc07fb08be294844ef) thus avoiding publishing it
- Volunteers keep meeting regularly, but there is general feeling of frustration. Ops communicate very little, and allow only very limited improvements. Volunteers one by one stop attending meetings. Lack of agency.
- 2022-10-05 - Volunteers [manage to merge](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/pull/2588#event-7522573117) the updated information about Foundation dissolution to trustroots repository master, but Ops refuse to deploy it

- 2022-09 - Trustroots repository is [forked](https://github.com/chmac?tab=overview&from=2022-09-01&to=2022-09-31) into [trustrootsops/trustroots](https://github.com/trustrootsops/trustroots) by Callum. This repository will be used as a source of truth for production application
- 2022-08 - Some volunteers want to [publish the information](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues/2585) [on the website](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues/2588) that Trustroots Foundation was dissolved, [Ops](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues/2585#issuecomment-1215005999) [disagree](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues/2585#issuecomment-1269698630)
- Ops move Trustroots to a new server hosted by Hetzner Online GmbH, and save it from disappearing
- Kasper shares access keys with Callum and later with Robino. They become the Ops
- 2022-07 - A group of current and former volunteers meets online, and talks about Trustroots future. Kasper and Callum propose to sunset Trustroots, others disagree
- 2022-06 - Technical difficulties: [email is down for several weeks](https://grafana.trustroots.org/d/000000002/members?orgId=1&from=1651356000000&to=1659304800000&viewPanel=2), and also [website is down for a couple of days](https://grafana.trustroots.org/d/000000004/messages-detailed?orgId=1&from=1655676000000&to=1657404000000&viewPanel=11). People start noticing that Trustroots may have troubles.
- 2022-05-24 - [Trustroots foundation is dissolved](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09489825), probably because annual legal documents weren't submitted.

- 2014-02 - BeWelcome holds [extraodinary General Assemblies](https://www.bevolunteer.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014_eGA1_Minutes.pdf) because BoD fell aparat. Also, Welen is discontinued. Conflicts among BoD and developer teams [are mentioned as reason](https://www.bevolunteer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/History_06-2017_Version2.pdf). Kasper, Callum, and some of the developers of Welen including Mikael move on to create Trustroots

## What can be done legally?

- ~~[Callum's claim](https://github.com/trustroots-community/trustrots/issues/5#issuecomment-1925839995) that he has had full support of Foundation can be verified or debunked~~ Apparently current BoD has support of at least one of the last directors
- ~~If they indeed delegated their authority, last [Foundation directors](https://www.trustroots.org/foundation) can withdraw it again according to [Foundation articles](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/document-api-images-live.ch.gov.uk/docs/54ezNEK6uAE3QxHfE26Xqn0EETa5Pb20zKj4Tvhw8Bo/application-pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAWRGBDBV3PPG3EMXY%2F20240310%2Feu-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240310T001732Z&X-Amz-Expires=60&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEPv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCWV1LXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCIQC0YsNo56NFgbDyq8IqgpS8AqBgwGtuugksUb4iOf0MuQIgfhGdN3RAn6WQAhJxlpvyqQUK9T2kbAMZndfi3uNSpsEqxAUI9P%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARAFGgw0NDkyMjkwMzI4MjIiDO3I8HawQSQ9sdAEICqYBQ76CFTp5LhRqS%2FxWKjkd%2BH7q9uqbcY%2BvapUxMzgCVJGA2xognlsIVKnGf0%2BDMYhi6kUg%2FZlVXjT0w9xsOoahoup2lF4OyOcPVqIIOEg%2FwgyN3m%2BW15ARHoyRzjEGr72MtGxBAL%2Bd5Gpseex33txPI0UX5E6mNRiVsYfWCd1MDrbQ9HlfQQ2z%2FhvQiT2rnLRdV3%2FlA7iY%2Fx1WEUE3SV%2F%2BPriizzZtY5bOSzPcV%2BID88Yud0Wjt0pvlWnnXwUR4jEE9YpEs4WYGOqHtlYWRBMOyDFivoe0nM%2BXxgje5bae1a1Svby4sVcxRohugp9pQrlYbQtvZRXS061%2FtZmkMFPe4lmzYz6fXWGsMe3izGxvMKszEj8pl800vVQ3cvDOC3fWEMFAAeLaN66Zp43q6X5r67StrhfREiK3opUo9vTntIzkUkvGvZhd9gWp1igWMawXkVbq9hyxnN7iimb1%2B8yZl8UoqcqTDebhgYmHP3zxJPsLwct5atpiyjZ8%2FNt7v5YjsrWMuWZG%2FketrQww5PhJeOPy99%2Fh4TVqOc7Wkzcb88oO%2F7o08D%2Bnyg8MnUzD0Av2LhsoXNWDWlIVX1d%2Bw04UY4e%2Bv66dRiCk1ElmWSispDrFKgExndTJ09QtNmHBQxxW%2BBQXJUYzmjMfmITkZwCFkmkqzquq1SraOw5sWazO0OvV2M0Qo8njk0seRVjm1V2sgLaTluUaAOmppZe%2Fay7PR0IfVmgDmY1nO%2FnZak919nJ8ikZWKZwEnqZsb5SqNtybxANA1MiJgxsK4zBVeZ%2FH7ba2WIyrBRuLGf7g6kLlHySflNaE87Iflk8AbGJH9yjzioy51MStwwO0Eb%2BewKL9%2BywvkroeMXU%2FiRKvxLdLwb6Dp0f32P4keYw59yyrwY6sQHdwdPN4YlEXESaEOnlk4gG%2BhAy%2F0ocaTddglbl8944be3X%2BsY6CFS8ujgFwRfHe79mb1HM1G3kQ%2FvVgX5fs9tAuui7wFN61c3rBBQOu8jbVWAlr%2F%2BEnGxadZDZf4tHFbnxRvqUWomBO%2F7mmv0o%2BfuogOWHbtU68yOQ3HVR4%2BCfh3I23RNRZHbMFWLVC1D4AsqUCMRI4z3gKwCbVHCyQpAUGTDNCvzZ6R8mOzL%2FlEskAQg%3D&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22companies_house_document.pdf%22&X-Amz-Signature=5f5c9792d01375dee35856a77b338d41de1f39566d4b577ffd03e447c1b071b0)~~
- Regarding GDPR, you can [exercise your rights](https://noyb.eu/en/exercise-your-rights) - from [withdrawing consent](https://noyb.eu/en/withdraw-your-consent) to [filing a complaint with GDPR authorities](https://noyb.eu/en/exercise-your-rights-article-77-complain-your-dpa) e.g. for lack of transparency about changes in data control. The latter can be done e.g. in Germany, where Trustroots server resides ([Hetzner Digital](https://www.hetzner.com/)). Now that the Foundation has been restored, this argument will be much weaker than over the past 2 years
